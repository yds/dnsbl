# CLI DNSBL checker

Cron friendly CLI [DNSBL][] checker utility.

### Introduction

Check if a hostname or IP address is blacklisted by any of
the [DNSBL][] sevices commonly subscribed by SPAM filters.

### Requires

 - [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org)
 - [dnspython2](https://www.dnspython.org)
 - [PyYAML](https://PyYAML.org)

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yds/dnsbl.git
cp dnsbl/dnsbl.yml /etc/
cp dnsbl/dnsbl /usr/local/bin/
chmod 0555 /usr/local/bin/dnsbl
```

### Usage

Edit and install the included `crontab` file:
```sh
MAILFROM=BlackMail@example.com
MAILTO=BlackMail@example.com
PATH=~/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
#
#minute	hour	mday	month	wday	command
#
15,45	*	*	*	*	dnsbl example.com
```
 - Change the email address where **BLACKLISTED** alerts will be sent _to_ and _from_.
 - Change `dnsbl` target host address to the FQDN or IP address you need to scan.

### Examples

Use with FQDN or IP address
```sh
dnsbl -v example.com
dnsbl -v 118.26.173.212
```

### Sample output
```yaml
$ dnsbl -v 118.26.173.212
...
The DNS query name does not exist: A 212.173.26.118.black.junkemailfilter.com.

```
Without the _verbose_ `-v` option only the BLACKLISTED section is
printed if there is anything blacklisted, otherwise there is no
output to keep `cron` quiet.

For each failed zone the BLACKLISTED section prints a label, any
URLs associated with that blacklist and the returned error code(s).

All the error messages printed with the _verbose_ `-v` option above
the BLACKLISTED section indicate the IP address is **NOT** blacklisted
in those zones.

### Blacklist providers

The distributed `dnsbl.yml` file of [DNSBL][] zones to query was compiled
from scraping https://HetrixTools.com/blacklist-check/ then running
`dnsbl -l` to merge http://MultiRBL.Valli.org/list/ "alive" zones and
prune any zones from the "dead" section.

Running `dnsbl -m` will output a [YAML][] format listing of all the IPv4
"blacklist" [DNSBL][] zones in the "alive" section of
http://MultiRBL.Valli.org/list/

Running `dnsbl -l` will output a [YAML][] format listing of all the zones
in the local `/etc/dnsbl.yml` file **plus** all the IPv4 "blacklist"
[DNSBL][] zones in the "alive" section of http://MultiRBL.Valli.org/list/
**minus** any matching [DNSBL][] zones from the "dead" section.

If your `/etc/dnsbl.yml` is up to date then running the following should
**not** produce _any_ output:
```sh
dnsbl -l > /tmp/dnsbl.yml
diff -u /etc/dnsbl.yml /tmp/dnsbl.yml
```
Otherwise you will see a unified `diff` which you can merge with your
production `/etc/dnsbl.yml` as need be.

### Config file format

`/etc/dnsbl.yml` is a [YAML][] dict with the `keys` made up of
[DNSBL][] zones to `query`. Optionally each `keys`' value _should_
have a URL followed by a tab `\t` and a description of the [DNSBL][].
The URL _may_ have a `{}` placeholder which if present will be
replaced by the blacklisted IP address in the output. Standard
[YAML][] comments and empty values are allowed.

Both `-l` and `-m` output a valid config file sorted by reverse
domain name. This sorting groups related zones together and allows
for `diff`ing against the installed `/etc/dnsbl.yml` config file.
